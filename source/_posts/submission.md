## 1 Peter 3

### Notes

1. Submit yourselves to God like slaves to his master
2. Wives should submit to their husbands, so when they do not believe the word, the see God in the behavior of their wives
3. Husbands, treat your wife with respect and do not let anything hinder your prayers
4. Repay evil with Blessing
5. Be eager to do good, who should harm you if you are doing good. And if they do, it is better in God's eyes to suffer for doing good
6. Baptism is a pledge of good conscious towards God and washes us like the great flood (21)

### Lesson

Submit ourselves to God like slaves, so that others may see our behavior and turn to God. This type of submission includes being respectful towards everyone, especially those who do evil towards you.
Bless those among you, even the evil doers. Do not let anything hinder your prayers with God. Staying focused on God and doing good is like a shield of protection, but if you do suffer, realize that God saw the good you did and loves you for it. Submit ourselves to cleansing, wash our sinfulness away (like the great flood) constantly.

### Prayer

Lord, I ask that you give me the heart of a servant towards you. Allow me to submit myself to your kingdom. The growth of the kingdom of God happens through your disciples. Give me opportunities to do good and bless those around me. Help heal my heart and throw away anything disrespectful. Remind me of your love and purity, and cleanse me everyday, so I can serve you better.
