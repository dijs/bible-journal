### Lesson

As the number of men grew in this early time, sin grew as well. All thoughts were sinful in this time. Although, Noah found favor in God's eye. He was a sinner, but was a righteous man. And because God is forgiving, he allowed Noah and his family to live. He commanded Noah to build a ark which would help them survive the flood which would wipe every other living person from the earth. Cleansing it from sin.

### Prayer

Thank you Lord for your forgiveness and love. In the darkest of times, You can be the one we can hold on to and pull ourselves out of the darkness of sin.
