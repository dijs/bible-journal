## John 6

### Notes

1. Jesus traveled to the far shore of Galilee followed by many because of his miracles (thinking Forest Gump)
2. We should always offer what we can to God, no matter how small it may be
  - 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish fed 5000 men with the help of God
3. Jesus didn't want the crowd to make him a king, so he left to be alone

### Lesson

We must trust in God. Our human eyes cannot fathom what is possible with what we can offer to help the kingdom of God. God's eyes can see every path and future we may decide. We should offer ourself to God in service and in gifts. What you give can have a tremendous impact down the road. As we see in the bible, Jesus used the small offering of a child to feed five thousand men. This could not have been done without God **and** the child.

### Prayer

Lord, I ask that you show me how I can serve you in my daily life. Allow me to show your love and wonderful gift you have to offer. Help me share the gospel wherever I may roam. I will trust in the truth that you are all powerful and can carry out your plan with what little I can give.
