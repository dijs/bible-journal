## Joshua 1

### Notes

1. After Moses died, Joshua was appointed leader of the Israelites
2. "No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you." - 1:5
3. "Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful." - 1:8
4. Joshua is readying his people for crossing the river and taking their land
5. Be strong and courageous (stated 4 times in this chapter)

### Lesson

The Lord made Joshua the leader of the Israelites after Moses died. He still had the promise of Joshua's ancestors to fulfill. God told Joshua all the land they would acquire and told him to get ready for battle. The Lord commanded them to continue to follow the Law and He will never leave them.

### Prayer

Lord, I ask you to give me the strength to be courageous, as Joshua was. Push me to keep your Word on my lips, and to meditate upon it throughout the days of my life.
