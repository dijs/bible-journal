### Lesson

In this passage we see the creation of Adam and Eve. Adam was created to work the garden of Eden, and survive be eating the food God provided. He was given the choice to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, although God commanded him not to. This was God's first commandment to man. Since man should not be alone, God created Eve out of Adam to be his partner. They were a perfect union, the first example of a marriage. God declares that men should leave their family when they find a partner, and become one flesh.

### Prayer

Lord, thank you for giving us the perfect example of marriage through Adam and Eve. You give us the freedom of choice because You want us to choose You! If we were forced to honor You, that feeling would be hollow and meaningless. Remind me to rest as You did after working, it is holy and I should spend it reflecting on You.

### Questions

1. Did God make the world for Adam and Eve, or were they just the ruling creatures?
2. When did God tell Adam to honor Him?
