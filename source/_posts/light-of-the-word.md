## John 1

### Notes

1. The "Word" has been around since the beginning, he was with and is God (Jesus)
2. "The Word was God"
	a. This was blasphemous to Jews
	b. Unthinkable for Greeks
	c. The good news for Christ followers
3. The darkness has never understood the light, therefore it cannot fully consume it
4. Allow Jesus to light your path and remove the darkness from your life
5. Jesus came into the world, His creation, and was not recognized or received by His own people.
6. To those who received Jesus, he gave them the right to become children of God
	a. Not through blood/birthright
	b. Not through human decision
	c. Not through a husbands will
	d. Through God
7. "He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me" (John the Baptist)
8. "From the fullness of His grace we have all received one blessing after another" (16)
9. Law came from Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus
10. When we truly understand who Jesus is, our pride and self-importance should melt away
11. Don't allow stereotypes cause you to share or miss Jesus. (like Nathanael with Nazareth)
12. Jesus acquires many disciples whom follow Him

### Lesson

John shows us in this passage who Jesus is. Jesus has always been with God, since the beginning, He is God. This was difficult for Jews and Greeks to understand and believe. Jesus is light, He has the power to overcome darkness. No sin is too big for Jesus to overcome. Even though He became flesh and was born into His own creation, very few of His people recognized Him. John the Baptist knew who Jesus was because He was waiting patiently for a specific sign. John was humble and allowed Jesus to baptize, teach, and gather disciples because John knew who Jesus was. Through Jesus we have grace and truth, all our blessings and good things come from Him. We should be humble, like John. Do not allow human stereotypes to hinder the path God has set for you to follow.

### Prayer

Thank you for allowing John to reveal this knowledge so that we may better understand who Jesus is and what He did and is doing. Shine the light for me, allow my path to be seen in this dark world. Thank you for your grace and truth, for fulfilling the prophesies of old. Do not allow me to use stereotypes as an excuse for not sharing the love and truth of Jesus.
