## Acts 14

### Notes

1. Paul and Barnabas preached at Iconium before fleeing in order to not be stoned
2. Paul could see in this cripple man that he had faith, so he asked the holy spirit to heal this man
3. The apostles don't preform the miracles, they ask the Holy SPirit to do so, because we have no power
4. Lycaonian were Greek?? They called P&B Zeus and Hermes
5. P&B become angry for the people are startling to worship them as gods...
6. Paul gives a testimony to the one true God, so that the people will believe
7. Paul shares that rain, food, and joy all come from God
8. A group of Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over, after which they stoned Paul almost to death
9. P&B ended up going back through these cities, even though it was probably dangerous
10. "We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God"
11. After a long time of traveling, they settled in Antioch and praised God for all He was doing through the Gentiles now

### Lesson

Paul and Barnabas traveled through many cities where they were in great danger and dealt with mis-belief, even after they had tried to set the record straight. They shared their testimony and preached the good news of Jesus. Some were saved in the cities, but many Jews wanted to stone and kill the men who were preaching. Paul tells us our walk on this earth will be hard when we are working for our Lord. If it easy, double check the path you are walking, and make sure you are working to strengthen the kingdom of God.

### Prayer

Lord, help me be thankful. You do so much for us and have given us more than we deserve. Allow me to put aside my earthly desires and temptations and look towards things which glorify You. Give me the opportunities to share the good news of your Son, and why he died for us. Remind me that a good life will be "hard", but that it is seen well in Your eyes.

### Questions

1. When do you run from your enemy? When you have shared the gospel, but they still are mistreating you?
