## Genesis 3

### Notes

1. The woman was tempted by Satan, then her human desires overwhelmed her desire to follow God and she disobeyed God by eating of the forbidden fruit
2. Adam was WITH the woman when she was tempted and he partook of the fruit also
3. It was common for God to walk through the garden of Eden with Adam and the woman
4. After God asked Adam why he ate the fruit, Adam blames the woman
5. The woman blamed the serpent for deceiving her and eating the fruit
6. God had to punish the sin committed
	a. Cursed the serpent to crawl on his belly and eat dust
	b. The woman will have pain in childbirth. Desire a husband, but he will rule over you
	c. The man was cursed to eat from the ground, and work the ground
7. Adam names the woman Eve, after all this has occurred.
8. God made them clothes and claimed man has become "one of us"
9. God kicked Adam and Eve out and guarded the garden with a flaming sword and cherubim on the east side

### Lesson

Even though Adam and the woman had everything they needed (food, shelter, each other), given to them by God, they were still able to sin. All it took was a small temptation from Satan to start sin throughout the offspring of the entire human race. After man's eyes are open, God asks them why they ate from the tree. Adam and the woman both blame someone else for sinning. This is just human nature, because we don't wont to take the blame, but we must not follow in the path of lying, we must trust that the Lord will forgive our sins. The serpent is cursed, then the humans are cursed and kicked out of Eden.

### Prayer

Lord, thank you for making yourself known to me. I know I was born as a sinful human, because I am the offspring of Adam. But, because of your grace, I was born again with the Holy Spirit living inside of me. Give me the strength to be open and honest and admit my sin, so I may be forgiven and help others who are struggling. 

### Questions

1. Why did Adam and the woman care that they were naked after eating the fruit? They are married and the only people around... 
	- God was around
2. What is the "hatred" that God put between woman and the serpent?
3. "he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel", what is going on here?
	- Notes say that this is Satan tempting Jesus, then being defeated after rising from the dead
4. Who is the "us" in 3:21
	- The trinity, angels?
