## 1 Corinthians 2

### Notes

1. Paul lets the church of Corinth know that he was not a man of superior wisdom when he shared his testimony
	- He was scared and weak
	- It was a demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit
2. When sharing the word, do not use human wisdom, but wisdom given from God
3. We should not rest our faith on the wisdom of man, but God's power
4. God has revealed to us his secret wisdom through the Holy Spirit
	- No one has seen, heard, or conceived what He is planning for those who love Him
5. No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit
6. We should express spiritual truths through spiritual words given to us through the Spirit
7. People without the Spirit cannot understand God's wisdom
8. Those who have the Spirit can judge about all things, but is not subject to earthly judgment
9. Through the guidance of the Spirit, we can have insight into some of God's plans, thoughts, and actions

### Lesson

Paul is teaching here about how the Holy Spirit can help us live for God. The Spirit gives us wisdom so we can share the Word of God. Even when we are full of fear, embarrassment, and weakness, the Spirit can intercede can give us the words to speak. We should not let our faith balance on the wisdom of man, for it is imperfect. God's wisdom is only available to those who have the Spirit within them. Since the Spirit has opened our eyes to the sins of this world, we can now judge all things of this world. Although, take care is solely judging. It is best to offer wisdom and solutions along with a judgment. We have the power, through the Spirit to ask for insight into His plans, thoughts, and actions. Our goal is to have a mind for God, constantly praying and thinking as God would, this can only be done through intimate study and prayer. 

### Prayer

Lord, thank you for the Holy Spirit. Please allow me to grow closer with You so I may have a mind for You. Do not let me rely on my own wisdom, but to ask for Godly wisdom so that I may be able to share the truths You have shared with us. Even when I am filled with fear, embarrassment, or weakness, I shall trust in the Spirit to give me strength and wisdom. Thank you for guiding me towards this passage.
