## 1 Timothy 2

### Notes

1. God wants us to live peaceful and quiet lives
2. If needed, stop praying to make peace with someone if they are interfering with your prayers
3. Do not bring attention to ourselves through clothes and makeup
4. Inner beauty to God is what is important
5. Paul is not degrading women here, he was giving women at this time an new opportunity to study quietly about God
6. Childbearing is important for women to learn more about faith, love, holiness... etc

### Lesson

Quietness is a good thing in God's eyes. WHen we are quiet, we can listen to God. Is there is strife, fix it, so we may live peacefully and holy for God. Focus on our inner appearance, not our outer, for this God does not care about and can lead to temptation for others. Know that women should study and learn about God.

### Prayer

Lord, teach me the gift of quietness. Let em listen for you.  You have so much to teach me and I crave your awesome wisdom to better live the path you want me to walk. Give me wisdom about my marriage and children. Give me the strength to fix any bad connections with people around me so that we may both live in peace. Help me focus on my inner beauty rather than looking good for others.
