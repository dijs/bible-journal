1. Written by Paul
2. Paul is continually praying for the Christians in Philippi
3. "I thank my God every time I remember you" - Phil 1:3

8. He accepts that being imprisoned helped advance the Gospel.
9. "Whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached" - Phil 1:18
10. He would rather die and be with Christ, because he knows the peace and joy this will bring him. But he knows he had more work to do on earth to spread the Gospel.

12. We must suffer for Christ

### Lesson

Paul is writing to his brothers in Christ in Philippi. Even though he has been through countless struggles and sufferings, he stays overjoyed through Christ! He is thanking them for their past support and is praying for them so that they may be encouraged and grow to love Christ more and more. This passage is a wonderful example of prayer. He shares with them that his imprisonment actually helped the kingdom of God. Where others would easily be bitter about imprisonment, Paul had joy in the fact that he brought more to Christ while imprisoned. We must suffer for Christ, this will show we are different, as Christ was. He did not walk the way of the world, and neither should we.

### Prayer

Lord, I ask that you allow us to suffer for You. Help us remember our brother Paul and the awesome lessons he gave us. Let his words strengthen our prayers towards You. Let them be an encouragement for us to support or become missionaries. Push us to love everyone, especially those who also love You. Motivate our hearts to beat for you. Let our worldly desires fall behind us and run towards You and your path for us. Amen.
