## Isaiah 1-2

### Notes

1. The people of Judah were rebelling against God by doing evil acts
2. God didn't want their offerings, since they were continuing to be evil
3. God tells them to wash themselves of evil and do good things (seek justice, encourage, defend the meek)
4. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18)
5. God decides to purge away the impurities because the people are not changing
6. There will be a mountain of the Lord in the last days (Isaiah 2)
7. "The law will go out from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."
8. "The Lord alone will be exalted and the idols will totally disappear"

### Lesson

During these dark times, the nation of Judah, God's people were not obeying God. They fell into their sinful desires. When God gave them many chances to stray from their evil acts, they did not. Because of their continuing evil, the Lord decides to purge the evil from his people by breaking the sinners and rebels and destroying the those who forsake Him. He will then turn the city around and appoint new leadership and the land will be called a righteous and faithful city. The second chapter shows how in the end of days, there will be a mountain where a temple of God will grant God's wisdom and knowledge. There will be no war, and He will judge the nations and settle disputes for people. There will be no more idols and the Lord will be exalted alone. This sounds like the end of days, possibly after revelation?

### Prayer

Lord, give me wisdom and insight into your Word. Help me understand the history of your people so that I may be a better servant for you. Push me to seek the Truth. Thank you for your forgiving and ever-loving heart. Even in their dark days, You were willing to save those who had faith in You.
