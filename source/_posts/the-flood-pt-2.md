## Genesis 7

### Notes

1. Noah did as God commanded him and built the ark
2. God sent the pairs of animals to Noah
3. God saved only the righteous men and the animals of the earth

### Lesson

Throughout Noah's life, we see that God saves Noah and his family, but also challenges him. Building a giant ark and convincing your family to follow you would not be an easy task. In this passage we see that Noah did as God commanded him and let God do the rest. We cannot fulfill God's plans by ourself. As much as we want to be, we are not supermen. But, we can help God. We can read his word, and pray and ask how we can further His kingdom. God gave us talents so that we may use them to share His grace and glory.

### Prayer

I ask you Lord to give me strength to trust that you can help me handle tough times in life. I know I cannot handle all life throws at me, so please intervene and give me strength and peace. You are the great healer and protector.
