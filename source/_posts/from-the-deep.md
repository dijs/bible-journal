## Psalm 130

### Notes

1. In this passage, the writer is crying out to God from the "depths". They are deep in sin, like many of us, but even at the darkest, God is light. He can pull you out of the deepest and darkest sins of man, because He is God
2. God does not keep a record of our sins, he is forgiving, which is why we should respect Him
3. The writer is being patient for the Lord to give him answers. He has put his hope in God
4. "My soul waits for the Lord more than the watchmen wait for the morning"
5. God will redeem Israel from all their sins

### Lesson

God is powerful and jealous, but also forgiving. It is these traits that make Him unlike any man. In the darkest times, He is near and will be a light for you. We should be patient for the Lord to act in His own time, and put our hope and trust in the Word of God. Our souls wait for the Lord in the morning. The writer here is talking about God saving Israel from all their sins, Jesus did that. We have been bought from the master of sins, so that we can choose to follow the Lord into eternity.

### Prayer

Lord, help me not to focus on all the sin in this world. There is and will always be an abundance of sin while only men rule this dominion. Help me to wait patiently for You, and expand Your kingdom until my time here is over or you join us. Thank you for your forgiving heart, for we are imperfect beings seeking a perfect Teacher.
