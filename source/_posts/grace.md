## Romans 4

### Notes

1. Paul is explaining to the Jews how Abraham was saved by faith in the Old Testament
2. No matter how weak or strong our Faith is, Jesus has died for us and will save us if we accept him
3. We cannot be saved through works. If we were, God would be fulfilling a obligation to pay of salvation for our work. We are saved by grace. God loves us so he sent Jesus to die so that we could all MAKE THE CHOICE
4. It is arrogant to think some sins are too big for God to forgive
5. A confessed sin is a forgiven sin (1 John 1:9)
6. Ceremonies and rituals do not save us. They can serve as a reminder of our faith. Focus on Jesus, not our actions
7. Jesus fulfilled Abraham's covenant in that "the entire world would be blessed through him". He gives all of them the opportunity to be saved by faith, not through the law
8. Have patience and trust that God will do what he promises

### Lesson

Paul just told the Jews that they are not saved through obeying the law. I am sure this was a very blasphemous statement at the time. Paul speaks about how a very honored figure in their history, Abraham, was saved through faith, not through obeying law. God promised Abraham he would father many nations and would bless them all through him. Through Abraham lineage, Jesus was born. Jesus died for us and gave the entire world the gift of salvation, it is our to accept through faith. We cannot be saved through works, it is not a work contract, where work is done and it is paid for. God loves us, so by grace, he paid for our sins with his sons, so that we may have the option of being saved. Abraham's circumcision and everyones after that was always just a symbol. It did not bring righteousness or salvation. Remember that ceremonies and rituals cannot save us, although if they bring people closer to God and remind us to have faith, they are useful. Have patience and be thankful for what God will do and has done for us.

### Prayer

Thank you Lord for your grace. Thank you that our salvation is not earned through a worldly competition in faith. Let me teach others how we are saved, and bring you more glory in their salvation.

### Questions

1. Must you confess a sin for it to be forgiven?
2. Are sins being covered and being forgiven the same thing?
