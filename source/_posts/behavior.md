## 2 Timothy 3

### Notes

1. Have nothing to do with ungodly behaviors
2. Even if hidden, sin will eventually show itself
3. Everyone who wants to live a godly live for Christ, will be persecutedby the world
4. Scripture equips us for good work in God's eye. It is our training manual to do good (2 Tim 3:17)

### Lesson

Paul tells us to not fall into bad behaviors, as the world will lead you to. He tells us that even those who hide their sin with a fake Christian life will eventually show itself. Be on the lookout for such behaviors and stay away from them. Though in doing so, we will be persecuted, God knows this and loves us for it. Remember, it is Christ-like to suffer for your faith. Our God-breathed life manual, the bible, should be used for training Christians to do good works. It shows us how to live a life for Christ, how to love, encourage, forgive, control ourselves, and do good. God wants us to be on our best God-like behavior. So others may see us and know God through us.

### Prayer

Lord, please allow me to show your love, wisdom, and goodness through my daily life. Help me stray away from sinful behaviors and even those that may lead to them. Help me to not be scared of being embarassed or hurt for you, this should make me joyful. For it is Christ-like. Help me learn from my training manual, allow me to soak up your wisdom and live the life you want for me so that I may bring more to your kingdom.
