## Joshua 4

### Notes

1. 12 stones from the Jordan river were set at the Israelite camp, they are there to this day (in Gilgal - east of Jericho)
2. The priests waited until all of Israel had crossed the river, then crossed themselves
3. The 12 stones were a memorial to the people of Israel and also represented the power of God
4. Before they conquered Jericho, Israel was reminded that God was still in control when they were told to move the stones

### Lesson

The people of Israel had just been told that everyone in Jericho was afraid of them, they were ready to conquer and take what God had promised them. But before war, God used the 12 stones as a forever reminder that He is in control and we should wait for him before we decide on anything.

### Prayer

Lord, I ask you to help me serve. Allow me to share the gospel. Be in control of my life so that your desires can be fulfilled through me. Help me slow down and focus on You. You are the God of the universe and creator of all.
