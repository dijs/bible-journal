## John 5

### Notes

1. Jesus was in Jerusalem
2. There was an area where many disabled people were grouped, mostly because they could not leave due to their illness or physical weaknesses
3. Jesus healed a man who had been there for 38 years.
4. The area he was at had a pool which an angel of the Lord would come down and heal the person in the center from time to time. Since this man was paralyzed, he never could make it down.
5. Jesus told him to pick up his mat and walk. Since this was the Sabbath, no work was to be done. So picking us his mat was against the law. This must be Jesus showing this is an old law that can be ...
6. Jesus found the man later and told him to stop sinning, since the man had probably never been taught, I don't think this was a mean gesture of Jesus, it was a lesson.
7. The man went and told the testimony of Jesus healing him
8. The Jews were very angry with him working on the Sabbath
8. Jesus explained why he was working on the Sabbath:
	a. God is always working, therefore Jesus constantly worked
	b. The Father shows the Son all he does
	c. The Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it
	d. Only the Son judges, because he is a Son of Man
	e. The dead (spiritually and physically) will hear the voice of the Son and live
	f. The Son does not seek to please himself, but the Lord
9. Studying scripture does not bring live, only believing in Jesus
10. Jesus explains that the work he is doing should be a testimony in itself as to the truth about Him being the Messiah
11. Since the Jews did not believe what Moses wrote, how could they believe in Jesus?
	a. Genesis 3:15
	b. Numbers 21:9
	c. Deuteronomy 18:15

### Lesson

After Jesus healed the paralyzed man, instead of praising Him and sharing in the joy, the Jews were angry. They were angry because he was not adhering to Jewish law and was "working", or maybe they was some jealously. Jesus explains the many reasons why they should change their attitude and believe in Him, so that they may have eternal life and accept the Messiah who is speaking to them. Maybe instead of  harassing people for doing something wrong, we should find something good to do instead, like Jesus. In this way, they might notice how we are different and want to know why? We tell them, "I do not do this to please myself, but I do this for the Lord".

### Prayer

Lord, I come to you for encouragement. Show me opportunities that I may do good in your eyes. Thank you for sharing your Son with us, so that we may not only study what he did, but believe in Him and share the same love He gives us with others. Push me to do good instead of useless bickering, which never helps the kingdom of God. Allow me to see what you have done, so that I may serve you better.

### Questions

1. Why did Jesus heal the one man in the disabled group?
	- To show the Jews healing/loving on the Sabbath was worth bringing a soul to God?
2. Is someones salvation more important than resting on the Sabbath
	- Seems like an obvious Yes, but would be great to find evidence
