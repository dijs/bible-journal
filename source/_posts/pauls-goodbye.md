## 2 Timothy 4

### Notes

1. Paul re-iterates the great commision: Preach the Word
2. Be prepared to preach, do so with patience and encouragment
3. "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith"
4. Share Christ with those close to you, like Paul
5. Trust and know that God with save us from all evil at the end, and bring us to safety in his kingdom

### Lesson

Even as Paul was near death and in prison, he continued to preach to the gentiles, trying to save every one he could. He also kept in touch with his friends and students, to keep them encouraged, so that they may keep the faith and bring others to the kingdom of God. Paul tells us to Preach the Word, just like Christ did. He tells us to do it with patience and encouragment. In order to do this, we must prepare ourselves every day, the Lord will give us the wisdom of what to preach, and we must ask for patience and encouragment, for those come from God. We do not have to be scared of evil, God will deliver us from all evil one day.

### Prayer

Lord, give me a partient heart. So that I may preach your Word to those around me. So that I may bring wisdom and encouragment to them. I do know want to keep you all to myself, but my fear causes me to do so. Help me rid myself of this fear and be strong in the faith, like Paul. Allow me to truly trust in you, that you will impower me to good works, share my faith, and turn away from evil. Help me fight the good fight. Help me finish the race. Help me keep the faith.
