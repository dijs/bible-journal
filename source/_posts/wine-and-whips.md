### Notes

3. Just as Jesus' wine was best, our life with Jesus is better
4. Timing is just before passover
5. When Jesus found men selling goods in a temple of God, He threw them out in anger
  a. He made and used a whip to scare the men away
  b. He claimed to be God's son
  c. The men might have been selling sacrificial animals in a scam-like system
6. The Jews demanded proof of His statement
7. "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days"
  a. Jesus was talking about His body, but the Jews did not understand
8. Even though many claimed to believe in Jesus after He preformed these miracles, He knew that some of them were superficial

### Lesson

In this passage we see Jesus' first miracle. Mary was concerned because the wine at the wedding feast had run out, so she turned to her son for help. Jesus turned water into wine for the party, after seeing what happened, His disciples believed in Him. When Jesus was visiting the temple of God, he found men selling sacrificial animals for profit within the temple. Jesus was outraged and make them leave while stating that He was the Son of God. The Jews wanted proof of His statement. He told them to destroy the temple and He would raise it in three days, although He was speaking of His own body. They did not understand. After these miracles, many people believed in Christ, although not all of them were truthful. Jesus knew who had real faith and who did not.

### Prayer

Lord, allow me to live life through You, and not wait till my wine is out before asking for help. Help me have the strength to share your word, love and wisdom. Do not let me have a superficial faith, but a faith that shakes others into believing.
