## John 3

### Notes

1. Jesus assures us that we must be born again (in the Spirit) in order to enter the kingdom of God
2. Just as we have no control over our first birth, we cannot control when/how the Holy Spirit finds us
3. Light exposes evil deeds, we should be clean so that we can step into the light and allow others to see what we do is for God, not ourselves
4. John the Baptist was baptising many people near Aenon
5. John's disciples and a Jew were arguing about ceremonial washing
6. "A man can only receive what is given to him from Heaven"
7. John fully understood his purpose. He had great joy that Jesus was "stealing" his glory and baptising more than he
8. "He must become greater, I must become less"
9. John repeats Jesus in reiterating that people are not accepting Jesus' testimony
10. In order to be pleasing to the Lord, if we believe in His Son, God's wrath will not harm us

### Lesson

We have two teachers in this passage. Jesus is helping Nicodemus understand how he can be saved. Which is interesting... Nico didnt ask Jesus how to be saved, he was just amazed at Jesus' miracles. Instead of "showing off" or gloating, Jesus decided to share the Word and save a life. We must be born again in the Spirit in order to enter the kingdom of God. John the Baptist had become popular and was baptising many people. When his disciples told him that Jesus was baptising also, instead of being jealous, he reassured them that he was not important, Jesus must become greater. THe lesson here is that John understood the path God set before him. It truly is amazing how "inline" he is with God's thinking. 

### Prayer

Lord, you have given us so much in this passage. Thank you for your Son. Thank you for fufilling your prophesies. Allow me to share with others that we must all be "born again" in order to be saved. We must believe in the Son. Help me have the focus and knowledge to follow the path you have for me. Help me be like John, who fully understood his purpose on earth. Give me the courage to become less, so Jesus may become more.
