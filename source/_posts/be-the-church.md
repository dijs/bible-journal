## Ephesians 4

### Notes

1. We have received a calling from the Lord, and we should live a life worthy of such
2. Keep the unity of the Spirit through peace.
3. Christ gives men(and women) gifts so that we can unite and become mature in faith and in knowledge of the Son of God.
4. Do not be an infant, who believes every teaching they hear
5. The Church should support and build up its members
6. Our old life was corrupted by evil desires, but our new life changes the attitude of our minds
7. "Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry" - Ephesians 5:26
8. Only allow helpfulness and building up come from your mouth
9. "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you" - Ephesians 5:32

### Lesson

This is a great passage which shows us how the Church should live and act with each other and non-believers. We have been given a gift and we need to live a life worthy of it. We must shed our old life and allow our minds to be transformed by Christ. We must, as a Church become mature in the faith and knowledge of Christ, so that the Church may help and build up its members. We must be different and show love to those around us, because Jesus showed us infinite love in dying for all of our sins.

### Prayer

Lord, allow me to be transformed and become mature in the faith and knowledge of You. Show me the gifts you gave me, so that I may help and build up the Church. Help me follow the teachings of your Word.
