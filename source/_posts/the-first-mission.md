## Acts 13

### Notes

1. God spoke to the members of the Antioch church after they had been worshiping the Lord and fasting
2. This is the first mission
3. We see "they placed their hands on them", a biblical ritual/tradition
4. Paul while filled with the holy spirit, called out a sorcerer's sins and temporarily "cursed" him, with blindness (God did the blinding of course)
5. The high Roman official (proconsul), which was the master of the sorcerer, was amazed by this and believed in the Lord
6. Paul taught some Jewish history in a synagogue as a precursor to teaching about Jesus
7. Paul showed them how Jesus fulfilled the prophesies which the Jews read every sabbath!
8. Paul uses Isaiah 55:3 and Psalm 16:10 as references to foreshadowing of God raising Jesus after death
9. Just as Abraham descendants received salvation, David's descendant Jesus will never decay (generational promises of God)
10. Some Jews were jealous that Paul and Barnabas were teaching Gentiles, but that is what Jesus commands us to do
11. Incited means encouraged
12. Some high ranking Jews had Paul and Barnabas thrown out of the city

### Lesson

In this passage, we see the first missionaries. It was quite a successful mission too! Paul and Barnabas ended up traveling to two cities and converted a high ranking Roman official and many Jews while preaching in a synagogue. It is important to note that Paul preached to his audience using knowledge which they could understand and appreciate. For example, when teaching the Jews about Jesus, he made sure to connect the dots which started in the old testament, since Jews take their history very seriously. While explain to the Jews who Jesus is and how he was killed and raised from the dead, Paul shows the foreshadowing of these events in the old testament. Even after leaving the synagogue, the disciples brought some gentiles to Christ, after some Jews showed jealousy because they wanted God for themselves. God sent his son to die for all of us, not only Jews.

### Prayer

What a incredible story, such encouragement here. Lord, I ask you to bring me the courage to open my heart and speak with those around me who need to hear the gospel. Please allow me to speak in terms and references that they can understand. Take the fear and embarrassment away from me, for nothing in this world is important when compared to you and your plan. Thank you for my brother who showed this passage to me.

### Questions

1. What do Jews read on every Sabbath?
