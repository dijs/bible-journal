## Ephesians 6

### Notes

1. Slaves are to obey their masters just like all followers should obey God, but their masters are supposed to treat them like Christ treats the Church. There is a balance.
2. We should use the *full* armor of God in order to defend against the devil's sinful schemes
  - Helmet of salvation
  - Breastplate of righteousness
  - Shield of faith
  - Belt of truth
  - Sword of the Spirit (Word of God)
  - Feet of peace (Gospel)
3. "Our struggle is against this dark world and the evil forces in the heavenly realms" Ephesians 6:12
4. Pray continuously

### Lesson

In order to defend and stand our ground against any sin, we should use what God has given us, His armor. In order to put on this armor, we must pray continuously, read the Word, and have a strong faith. Paul also gives commands to children to obey and honor their parents, to parents to raise their children in Christ, to slaves to obey their masters, and to masters to treat their slaves as Christ would.

### Prayer

Lord, allow me to use the knowledge You have given me through study as armor for evil. There is still much to be learned, but keep my eye on the goal of wearing the full armor of God. "Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel".
