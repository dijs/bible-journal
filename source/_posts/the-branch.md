## Isaiah 11-12

### Notes

1. The shoot growing from Jesse's stump = King David
2. From David's tree roots a Branch will bear fruit = Jesus
3. The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him (This is a common theme for showing the Messiah)
4. The rest is talking about what it would be like in the golden age, the second coming of Jesus
5. Not all was fulfilled during the first coming (This is probably the hard part for Jew's)
6. God will bring his people back to their homeland and Christ will rule
7. God can be angry with us, but He is our comfort
8. In the golden age, people will shout joy for the Lord and sing about what He has done. We should be doing this now to praise Him.

### Lesson

This chapter foretells where Jesus comes from and what He will do. The Spirit of the Lord will fall on Him during his first coming, and He will rule during His second coming. The second chapter shows how people will react during the golden age or the second coming of the Lord. ALl will sing joy and praise for what the Lord has done and He will comfort us and be our strength.

### Prayer

Lord, help me understand the first and second coming of your Son. Please give me the wisdom to help others know that Jesus had to be born of this earth and die for our sins, then return to rule. Thank you for giving us the Holy Spirit. I truly believe you impart your love and wisdom through your Spirit which lives inside us. I thank you for allowing me to trust in you. I ask that you keep me focused on You in the days to come. Help me share Your glory with others. Give me the courage and the words to speak. To You, all the praise.

### Questions

1. I would really like to have evidence of Jesus' first and second comings in the old testament. Hopefully in the Pentateuch.
