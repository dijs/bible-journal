## Genesis 1

### Notes

1. Creation
	1. Heavens (universe), a formless planet (ball of water, probably a core with one huge ocean) and light (general)
	2. Sky (different levels of atmosphere)
	3. Dry ground, seas, and vegetation
	4. Sun, moon and stars
	5. Sea and sky creatures
	6. Land animals and man (who is an image of God and rules over all the earth, both men and women)
	7. God rested and blessed that day (technically in Gen 2)

### Lesson

God created and molded the earth and it's surroundings to his desire. We know it was his desire, because He tells us it was a good creation after every day of work. The order of His creations is important, each could not come before the other. It is interesting to see the pattern between God and his creation, and man and earthly things. God made man in His own image and created man to rule over His creation.

### Prayer

Lord, in every part of nature I see, let it remind me that You are the creator. You are in control of everything. Help me stay in prayer with You and study so I may know the plans You have for me.

### Questions

1. Why did He appoint man to rule over all the creatures?
