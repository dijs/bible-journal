## Romans 9

### Notes

1. God decides who receives mercy
	- He decided that Jacob would be loved over Esau
	- He hardened the Pharaoh's heart so that His name would be known
2. God, like a potter made humans for noble and common purposes
	- A common purpose might be to show his Glory through being destroyed
3. We cannot demand anything from God, he created us
4. Isaiah prophesied that only a small number of Jews would be saved
5. We can NEVER do enough good works in God's eyes. We cannot follow the law enough. We must put our faith in Jesus, it is the only way God will view us as clean and acceptable.
6. Jesus is the rock. Some stumble over it because they are unwilling to accept Him, or follow His values. And some may build their life on Him!	

### Lesson

This passage shows God's authority over man. God is our creator, not our peer, or even parent figure. We each have a purpose, although we often do not understand God's purpose through our human eyes. In order to unlock that purpose, we must realize that we cannot do enough for God on our own, He must intercede and take over our lives. The only way to be seen as acceptable in God's eyes is by believing that Jesus is the Son of God and allowing Him to cover us with His Glory. He is the Rock which we should build our life on, though many will stumble over it.

### Prayer

Lord, Your path is not easy. I cannot do it alone. I ask that You allow the Holy Spirit to overtake me when I am acting selfishly. My life is not my own, You created me, I have a purpose. What it is, I do not know, I may never know. Our human minds and eyes can see and understand so little. Allow me to have the strength to share Your love and follow Your path.
