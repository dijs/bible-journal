## Romans 7

### Notes

1. We should focus on bearing fruit for God
2. Naturally, the old laws (10 commandments and others), produce sinful desires in our hearts. (Out heart wants what it can not have, or restricted from. Just like Adam and Eve)
3. The law is essential and shows us what sin is, but not how to be rid of it.
4. "For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do"
5. Evil is right there with us when we want to do good things
6. We are all natural slaves to the law of sin, but we have the opportunity to become slaves of God also.

### Lesson

Following the law is hard. Don't think you are the only one tempted by sin, we all are! By knowing the laws given to us by God, we became aware of sin, but we also were restricted from it. This causes the rebellious nature of us to thrive. After knowing the laws, it is a constant battle between our sinful and Godly thoughts. The good news is we have the opportunity to die to that sinful body, and be reborn with the Holy Spirit living inside of us. This does not save us from being tempted, but saves us from the penalty of sin, for Jesus died to cover all sin. Only through trusting him can we surround ourselves with his glory and be viewed as beautiful to God.

### Prayer

Lord, I ask you to help me follow your laws and keep me on the path you want me to walk. My sinful heart is constantly tempted and battle-worn, please renew it and give em your sword, shield and helmet. I want to protect myself from temptations and serve You by sharing Your awesome Love, Kindness and the precious gift, Jesus.

### Questions

1. How is sin different after being saved?
