## 1 Timothy 1

### Notes

1. Written by Paul to Timothy
2. Do not teach false doctrine, or devote yourself to myths. This promotes controversies rather than advancing God's work
3. Love, with a pure heart and good conscience
4. Know that Christ came to save all sinners - even me, the worst
5. God handed over Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan to show them a lesson

### Lesson

Show focused to God and follow his path for you show that you may advance His work. When we get caught up in myths, or false doctrine, this does nothing for God. Keep a good conscious and stay strong in your faith, and know that Jesus excepts all sinners.

### Prayer

Lord, I ask that you help me keep a good conscious and tighten my hold of faith towards you. Help me not use myths against your will. But answer me, am I supposed to be a blind follower? I want to know my Lord and leader and be able to share all of his features to the world without blemish. Give me wisdom in this area.
