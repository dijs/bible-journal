## Romans 8

### Notes

1. Since the law offered no power over sin, God sent Jesus in the likeness of a sinful man to be an offering
2. "Those controlled by a sinful nature cannot please God"
3. "If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus"... (tri-god)
4. "Those who are led by the Holy Spirit are sons of God"!
5. Since we are children of God, we are heirs of God also
6. In order to truly be sons of God, we must suffer like the Son of God did
7. We cannot save this world, but we can save souls and fight the evil effects of sin
8. "Hope that is seen is no hope at all"
9. The Holy SPirit within us intercedes for us when we do not know what to pray for 
10. Through God's plan (or purpose), He calls those who has has predestined to be justified and glorified (Calvinist?)
11. If you have believed in Christ, you can rejoice in that God has always known you... amazing
12. "If God is for us, who can be against us" (8:31)
13. "For your sake we face death all day long"
14. Nothing can separate us from the love of God

### Lesson

In this passage we look again how Jesus can save us and overcame the power of sin, where the old law could not. We see how being a believer in Christ affects our lives. When we believe, we become his children. Although, in God's eyes, we have also been his children because he knew that we would chose him, we are part of his plan. We should rejoice in this! For if He chose us, there must have been a purpose, we should continually pray to God and seek guidance in this purpose. Even when we do not know what to say, the Spirit will help us. For we cannot save this world, but by using the gifts He has given us, we can follow GOd's path for us. Do not be afraid of suffering, for that is what makes you a son of God. We face sin and death everyday, though we should not fear it, for God is with us. Nothing can separate us from God's love.

### Prayer

Thank you Lord, for knowing me. It is inconceivable that You have always known those who would help fufill your plans for this world. To those who trust in Your Son, you have given everything. Allow me to trust You and rejoice in the fact that nothing can separate us from You. Remove the fear from might heart so that I might suffer for You, like Christ did. Help me not be controlled by my sinful nature and focus on the unbounded grace and love you have for us. I put my hope in You.
