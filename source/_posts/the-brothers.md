### Lesson

Adam and Eve gave birth to two sons, Cain, then Abel. They each had a job, and knew of offerings. Abel gave an offering which was pleasing to God. Cain gave an unfavorable offering, we do not know why it was unfavorable though. It could have been the bad parts of his fruits, or he could have given with a wicked heart. We must give our offerings to God with a joyful heart. Cain is angry that God saw favor with Abel. He is the eldest, he is probably jealous. But God find him and tries to mend the issue, the tells him he can receive the same favor if he does what is pleasing to God. Cain falls into his human temptations, which turns into sin, then death. Cain kills his brother Abel. He is punished and cast into another land where is he cursed. Adam and Eve have another son, Seth. Many generations are born after this. Cain's offspring is sinful. Seth's offspring are men of God.

### Prayer

Lord, let me give to your kingdom with a joyful heart. Even if I falter, I know you will reach out and offer your hand to me. Do not let me be overwhelmed with temptations, which lead to sin and death. Allow the Holy Spirit to be a shield for those temptations.

### Questions

1. Did God mean to create more humans in the garden of Eden? Or were Adam and Eve to be the only ones?
