## 2 Timothy 1

### Notes

1. "Fan into flame the gift of God"
2. The spirit gives us the power, love, and self discipline
3. Grace was given to us before Genesis, but revealed with Jesus
4. Guard the gifts that God has given us, and use it as God intended

### Lesson

God has and will give us so much during our lives here on earth. These gifts are intended to be used for learning about God's path for us, loving the Lord more and more, and expanding the kingdom of God. These gifts are precious, because they are holy and from God. He wants us to keep them guarded with the help of the Holy Spirit, and train them so we can be more useful.  

### Prayer

Lord, I ask you to show me the gifts you have granted me and empower me to grow those skills, so that I may be more useful for your kingdom. I thank you for your grace, for it is everlasting. Help me show those around me your awesome power and love, and give me self discipline so they will know I am different because of You.
