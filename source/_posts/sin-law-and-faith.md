## Romans 3

### Notes

1. God hates all sin, even if it causes good
2. Jews and Gentiles are equal towards God because of sin
3. We do not become righteous by reading and keeping the law
4. The Word/Law keeps us knowledge and wise in order to receive God's plan for us
5. All sins before Jesus were left unpunished
6. Trust in the Lord Jesus to forgive our sins and make us white as snow for God to see
7. Even though we are saved by faith, we should still uphold the law, because we will stay closer to God's path for us

### Lesson

This passage shows us how all humans are equal when compared to God. We all sin. God hates sin and cannot be around it. Because of his grace, he sent his Son to die for us, which covers all human sin. It is good to remember that studying and obeying the law does not save us. Only faith in Jesus saves us. Think about it, no reading or doing good is going to erase our past sins. Only something supernatural can do so. His name is Jesus, the Son of God. Now, the Word of God is very important, and we should all keep the laws. By obeying the laws and studying God's Word, we can gain wisdom and better understand how to deal with life's issues in a Godly manner. We can also receive encouragement through studying, we are not alone in sin, even though Lucifer would like us to think so. Sin is ancient and humans have been repeating the same sins for thousands of years, use this history to learn from our forefathers and not fall into the same temptations.
