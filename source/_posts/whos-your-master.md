## Romans 6

### Notes

1. We should view our spiritual birth as a new beginning in our lives, just as Jesus rose from the dead through the glory of God
2. Anyone who has died has been freed from sin
3. Before being saved, we were slaves to our sinful body, which we inherited from Adam
4. Christ cannot die again, he has mastered it
5. Offer the parts of your body to God as instruments, not to sin for our selfish desires
6. "Sin shall not be our master"
7. Become a slave to God, which leads to righteousness, holiness, and to eternal life
8. For through sin, only death awaits, but the gift of God promises eternal life in Jesus

### Lesson

Sin is ancient and wicked. God cannot live with it. So, because He is Glory, He sent his son to die which paid for all the sins of humanity. Once he rose again, he had mastered not only sin, but also death. This picture is a pattern of what our spiritual life should look like. We are born with Adam's sinful desires. Before we are saved, we were a slave to our "sin master", after trusting God and accepting Jesus' gift, we obtain the Holy Spirit and have the choice to follow God's path for our life, or continue to sin. God promises us righteousness, holiness and eternal life when we drop our sinful life and walk His path for us, so that we may expand His kingdom.

### Prayer

Lord, help me understand your path for me. Thank you for your gift given to all of us through Jesus. Thank you for the choice we have to follow You, or to sin. Encourage me to show the unsaved they are slaves to their "sin master" and they can be set free to follow a loving, protecting and grace-filled master. Remind me "Sin shall not be my master".

### Questions

1. Can the unsaved life a righteous life without sinning?
	- No. We are all born with sin, the sin of man. Living a "good" life is not enough for God. He is jealous and wants you to follow him. If you are without sin, but you do not follow God's path, who are you following? Yourself. We alone cannot know what is best for everyone, that is why we can follow God to find out how we may do just that.
