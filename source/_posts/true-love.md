## Romans 5

### Notes

1. We now have peace with the knowledge that God saves us through Christ because of his grace
2. We should rejoice in our sufferings, it builds perseverance, character and hope.
3. Realize that Christ died for us WHILE WE WERE STILL SINNERS! Some people may die to save a "good" person, but we were all still full of sin. This is true love. 
4. The Holy Spirit gives us God's love and power for our daily life and our walk with God
5. The law points out our sin, but only Jesus can heal us from sin
6. Adam was a pattern for Christ.
	a. Through Adam bloodline, sin and death flows through the generations. Through Jesus, forgiveness and life are spread.
	b. After one act of sin, we were all condemned. Through one act of love, we all have the ability to be saved.
	c. Through one act of disobedience, many sinned. Through Jesus' obedience, many will become righteous.

### Lesson

This passage shows us the true love of Jesus. He died for us, even after we never stopped sinning. We should rejoice and have peace about this. God's grace is real and He has given us the Holy Spirit to continue his plan though us. Share the love He gives us, the Word of the Lord, and the good news of Jesus Christ. If you suffer while doing so, rejoice! Suffering because of these things will bring glory to God and will build up our perseverance, character and hope. Know that Adam was a pattern for Christ. As his sin flows through generations, Jesus' love and forgiveness will flow through the disciples who carry out God's plan.

### Prayer

Lord, remind me to rejoice today. Your love is overflowing, even we we are sinners, you continue to forgive. Thank you for giving us Adam, to show us our true nature. Thank you for giving us Your Son, to show us what we can be. Take away my fear of suffering and embarrassment, and push me to share the knowledge and wisdom You have given me.
