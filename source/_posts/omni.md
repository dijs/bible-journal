### Prayer

Lord, I ask that you always remind me of your position in this world. You are the one true God. Above all others. In this modern world, I believe there are many gods, and their temptations are strong. Give us the stength to run towards you and be a part of your mission. Though we are miniscule to you and powerless, you love us and believe in us. Help me live as if your son Jesus could come at any time and help me serve your kingdom.
