## 1 Corinthians 1

### Notes

1. Written by Paul
2. Continuously thank God for our fellow believers, through God's grace we were saved and found each other
3. Paul is pushing the Corinthian church to agree with one another so they may be united in mind and thought
4. "We do not preach with human wisdom"
5. To those who will perish, the message of Jesus will be foolishness... (rephrasing of what Paul says)
6. "Jews demand miracles, and Greeks look for wisdom"
7. "The foolishness of God is wiser than the man's wisdom"
8. "God chose the foolish of the world to shame the wise"
9. "Boast in the Lord"

### Lesson

Paul is writing to the church in Corinth because there are quarrels. The believers are divided in their beliefs. Paul is showing them to find wisdom in Christ, so that they may agree with one another and be a united church who can grow the kingdom of God. We cannot preach with our human wisdom, it must come from the Holy Spirit who lives within us. Many will view our message as foolishness, God knew this would happen. We must trust in the fact that God's foolishness is wiser than man's wisdom. Arguing with one another, be it believer or non-believer will not help God's kingdom. Stand firm in the faith. It will be difficult, God knew this. We will suffer, God knew this. Know that you are spreading the greatest gift of love in this world.

### Prayer

Lord, I ask for Your strength and wisdom. Do not let me rely on human wisdom to do Your work. We can do nothing for Your kingdom without You. Some will demand miracles and wisdom, and I trust You will show them if it is in Your will for them to be saved. Allow me to have patience with my fellow believers and to not argue, but be united with them. Allow me to focus on You, know that You will show me the path You want me to walk. Push me to not worry about being a foolish human, I know I have the wisdom of God inside me, who is the Holy Spirit.
