## Ephesians 2

### Notes

1. Before being saved, we were dead in our sins
2. By grace we are saved, because God is merciful
3. We are *not* saved by works
4. Are salvation is a gift
5. God prepared good works for us to do before we even found salvation!
6. Remember, and do not forgot the sinful life you lived before God. Do this so you can give thanks to Christ for saving us from that life.
7. Because of Jesus we now have access to the Holy Spirit
8. As christ followers, we are building the foundation of our Church through the experiences, teachings and lives of past christians. Spiritual Heritage.

### Lesson

Do not forget your sinful life. This is a tough command. We all have difficult areas of our lives. And some of us may be trying to let go and forget the sins we committed in the past. But in this passage, we are taught that our past sins can be a reminder of how Jesus saved us from them. Not only learn from your mistakes, but be joyful because God had enough mercy to save us even in our sin.

Because our salvation is a gift from God, we should not boast of good works. This creates strife in a community. Jesus preached peace while he was on this earth, and we should continue to do good works without bringing attention to ourselves, because it is for God we are doing them. We are his workers, and he has plans for us.

### Prayer

God, I continue to ask You to make my path clear. In this quick paced world, it is difficult to be steady and listen. Push me to be still and listen, so I can find You.
