## 1 Timothy 6

### Notes

1. Do not think that godliness is a means to financial gain
2. Be content, for we can bring nothing with us out of this world
3. Men who wants riches fall into temptations more easily
4. Do NOT love money
5. Pursue Godly traits instead of money
6. "Fight the good fight of the faith"
7. Put your hope not in money, but God. And he will provide for our enjoyment (not just basic needs)
8. Be generous and willing to share
9. God gives us our wealth for His use, we need to take care of it and use it for His glory.

### Lesson

Do not love money. It is easy to fall into the temptation of loving money and as you have more the temptation can grow. Always be content with what you have and know that God has given it to you for His glory. If you have wealth, share it and help expand the kingdom of God with it. If you are not wealthy, pursue Godly traits, for they are greater than wealth in God's eyes.

### Prayer

Lord, thank you for everything you have allotted to me. I pray that you show me how to benefit your kingdom with what you have given my family. Help me not fall into temptation of loving money or getting rich. Help me stay content with the vast wealth you have already bestowed upon us. Help me pursue Godly traits instead of wealth. Give me wisdom to know how to spend money in a Godly manner.
