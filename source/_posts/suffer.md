He knows that the world will make us suffer for this, and we should rejoice, becuase it is the right thing to do. Continue to be humble and resist the devil, and if anythign is too much for us, cast it to God. He wants to help us serve him during our time on Earth.

Lord, I ask that you take all my fears and anxiety away so that i may be a humble servant for you. I want to be a great example and teacher to your flock. Please show me the path to follow, if I suffer, remind me that suffering for you is worth rejoicing. Help me share the gospel, and show your love to those around me, and stand strong in my faith.
