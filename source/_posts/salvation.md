## John 4

### Notes

1. Jesus' disciples were baptizing people
2. Jesus tells the Samaritan woman about living water next to Jacob's well
3. At this time, the Jews claimed everyone must worship in Jerusalem
4. Jesus explained that God's spirit is everywhere and can be worshiped anywhere
5. We must worship in spirit and in truth
6. When Jesus was offered food to eat, he knew that the Samaritans salvation was more important than eating at the time (priority)
7. The woman shared her testimony and many came to Christ
8. Jesus exclaims that the people will only believe if he does miracles
9. Jesus heals a boy just by speaking about him from far away

### Lesson

We can see in this passage how important others salvation is to Jesus. He would rather starve than keep people from knowing who he is and how to be saved. Jesus didn't let a cultural difference stop him from sharing the good news with the woman at the well, we should not let anything stop us from the same. We should not only worship in so-called holy places. God is everywhere, with the gift of the Holy Spirit, we can worship anywhere and speak to God. Towards the end of the passage, a father asks Jesus to save his boy. He trusts that Jesus can do and will do it, and this Faith is what was important. The boy was saved just as Jesus spoke, which later brought many others to Christ.

### Prayer

Lord. Help me calm myself and forgive. Allow me to do this so I may serve you better. Please share with me the wisdom to know what to say when the time comes for me to help someone who is seeking you. I need strength and encouragement, I know and trust that these things come from you. All good comes from you. Do not let me be blinded by cultural differences, push me to share my testimony, and help me strengthen my faith.
